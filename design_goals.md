General changes
General
•	Across the board increases to ROF
•	Projectiles fly farther than their targeting ranges
Small grid
•	More accurate than large grid, but less velocity as projectiles inherit the ship’s velocity.
Large grid
•	Less accurate due to less evasiveness. Effective long-range fire versus other large ships.
Gatling
•	Decrease damage
o	Reduce DPM
•	Decrease accuracy
•	Decrease velocity
•	Increase ammo/mag
•	Increase ammo costs
Gatlings are extremely cost-efficient and should not be primary damage dealers. Gatlings should be point defense weapons limited to short ranges.
Rockets
•	Increase splash radius
•	Increase accuracy
•	Increase max velocity
•	Decrease init velocity
•	Decrease acceleration
•	Add gravity
Rockets should be a quick-burst weapon that lets small ships and less-equipped large ships punch above their weight. Their self-propulsion makes them equally dangerous at long range as at short range.
Assault cannons
•	Decrease damage
o	Maintain DPM
Assault cannons should be powerful secondary batteries that deliver lethal penetrating fire to enemies at medium range.
Artillery
•	Decrease damage
o	Maintain DPM
•	Make shells HE
o	Less splash radius than rockets
Long-range saturation damage that pulverizes weapons, armor, and systems equally.
Railguns
•	Significant range increase
•	Velocity increase
•	Energy requirement increase
•	Maximum charge rate increase
o	Corresponding ROF increase
Precision AP weapon that punches through armor and rips ships to pieces at extreme distances.
